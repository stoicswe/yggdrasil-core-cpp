## Branching

Whether fixing issues or adding new features, branch naming has always been a debate as to what the naming
scheme should be. Branches for this project _should_ be called according to the following naming conventions
for this project:
- if the branch is to cover an issue then it should be called: `I-ISSUE#`, for instance: `I-1234`.
- if the branch is to implement a new feature, that branch should be called: `F-SomeShortDesc`, for example: `F-ConcensusAlgorithmImprovement`.
- Sub-branches of feature branches, should be called according to the following convention: `DATE.FeatureName`, for example: `2021.03.08-ConsensusAlgorithmImprovement`.

## Commits

You may use as many commits as needed for your branches, but keep in mind that you will be required to squash your
commit messages so that the commit history is clean.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Make sure your branch builds successfully before making a pull request. If you do not test locally 
   and instead utilize the git workflow to check it for you, then 
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one but preferably two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
